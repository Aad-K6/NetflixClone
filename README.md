This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Install Node.js:
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website. When you install Node.js, it usually comes with npm (Node Package Manager).

Install Yarn (optional):
If you prefer using Yarn, you can install it by following the instructions on the Yarn installation page.

Install pnpm (optional):
If you prefer using pnpm, you can install it by following the instructions on the pnpm installation page.

Navigate to your project directory:
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your project using the cd command.

Install project dependencies:
Run the appropriate command to install the project dependencies. If your project uses npm, run:
First, run the development server:
```bash
install npm
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
